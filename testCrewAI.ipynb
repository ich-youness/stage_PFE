            "* **Improved Data Extraction:** Implement more robust methods for extracting data from the source webpage.  This should include not only the movie title and rating but also detailed descriptions, director information, release date, genre, and other relevant metadata.  Tools such as web scraping libraries (Beautiful Soup in Python, for example) and potentially APIs could be employed for this purpose.\n",
            "* **Data Cleaning and Validation:** Once the data is extracted, it should be thoroughly cleaned and validated to ensure accuracy and consistency. This may involve handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies in data formats, and removing duplicates.\n",
            "* **Enriched Data Sources:** Consider incorporating data from other sources, such as IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, or Box Office Mojo, to provide a more holistic view of each film and to fill in any gaps in the existing data.\n",
            "* **Advanced Analytical Techniques:** Once a complete and accurate dataset is assembled, more sophisticated analytical techniques can be applied, such as statistical analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling, to derive deeper insights into the trends and patterns in the data.\n",
